Keep in mind that you may be reviewing the papers of students who are new to research and the community, or more generally, the papers of authors who have invested a lot of time and effort into their work. Your review should be constructive. Your review should include discussions of both positive and negative aspects rather than focusing only on negatives. Your review should not be disparaging or dismissive, and should avoid unnecessarily negative language. Until proven otherwise, you should assume good faith on the part of the authors. Avoid calling into question the ethics or honesty of the authors, but rather keep your review factual. If you have an ethical concern regarding a paper, please discuss it with other PC\/SPC\/Chairs first to make sure there is consensus that the concern is indeed well-founded.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-a0f8de4 elementor-widget elementor-widget-shortcode\" data-id=\"a0f8de4\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"shortcode.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-shortcode\">\n<table id=\"tablepress-14\" class=\"tablepress tablepress-id-14\">\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"row-1\">\n\t<th class=\"column-1\">Examples to avoid<\/th><th class=\"column-2\">Better examples<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<\/thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"row-2\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">\u201cThe writing is terrible\u201d<br \/>\n<br \/>\n(Unnecessarily disparaging and dismissive.

Failing that, we prefer no consensus to an artificial consensus where recommendations are changed just for the sake of aligning them.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-a8a0401 elementor-widget elementor-widget-shortcode\" data-id=\"a8a0401\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"shortcode.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-shortcode\">\n<table id=\"tablepress-15\" class=\"tablepress tablepress-id-15\">\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"row-1\">\n\t<th class=\"column-1\">Examples to avoid<\/th><th class=\"column-2\">Examples to follow<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<\/thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"row-2\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">\u201cThis paper must be rejected due to having multiple typos, missing references to similar works in related areas, and bugs in Equation 1.\u201d<br \/>\n<br \/>\n(All such issues have clear resolutions that could be easily addressed for the camera-ready version. Few specific details are provided to justify the recommendation or improve the work.)<\/td><td class=\"column-2\">\u201cFor a future version of this paper (potentially the camera-ready version, if accepted), the authors should be sure to address the following minor comments:<br \/>\n<br \/>\nPlease spell-check, e.g., 'qeury', 'frgment', etc.The authors should acknowledge similar works in relational databases, e.g., by pointing to the survey of Roe et al. [A]. In Equation 1, max should be replaced by arg max.\u201d<br \/>\nOR<br \/>\n<br \/>\n\u201cThe paper has many grammatical errors and notational bugs that made it difficult for me to follow and review. I fear that other readers, even experts in the area, would likewise have difficulty understanding the work. For this reason I recommend a reject. Below I will provide some illustrative examples of these issues, which should be addressed for a future version\u201d<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-3\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">\u201cI am rejecting this paper because one could obviously achieve better performance in Algorithm 1 by parallelising the branches.\u201d<br \/>\n<br \/>\n(This is speculative. It is best offered as a suggestion for future work, rather than a reason to reject. The suggestion might only be obvious after reading the paper.)<\/td><td class=\"column-2\">\u201cAs part of future work, I think it would be interesting to explore the idea of parallelising the branches in Algorithm 1, which may lead to further performance improvements.\u201d<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-4\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">\u201cOne argument for rejecting the paper is that the current approach does not support updates, which are crucial in practice.\u201d<br \/>\n<br \/>\n(Even though updates are important and not considered, the approach could be extended in future. The justification for rejection should consider what is presented, not what is not presented.)<\/td><td class=\"column-2\">\u201cThe work achieves impressive results for the read-only case. Though a complete solution would require support for updates, the authors discuss how such features could be combined with the proposed approach in future.\u201d<br \/>\n<br \/>\nOR<br \/>\n<br \/>\n\u201cOne reason for rejecting the paper is that the current approach does not support updates, and there is no clear way in which the method could be extended to support updates due to the nature of the data structure proposed. The paper does not discuss this issue. While a highly-optimised read-only index might still be a useful contribution, the approach proves to be only marginally faster than baselines that do support updates.\u201d<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-5\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">\u201cThe paper does not deal with the case of cyclic graphs, and hence I recommend rejection.\u201d<br \/>\n<br \/>\n(Even without considering the cyclic case, the results for acyclic cases might be an important contribution. The justification for rejection should consider what is presented, not what is not presented.)<\/td><td class=\"column-2\">\u201cThe paper proves a novel tractability result for the case of acyclic graphs using new techniques. This begs the question of what happens in the cyclic case, which seems an interesting direction for future research based on these results.\u201d<br \/>\n<br \/>\nOR<br \/>\n<br \/>\n\u201cWhile the paper proves a novel tractability result for the case of directed acyclic graphs, it is a minor extension of a similar result by Boe et al. [A] for trees, and uses the same techniques.\u201d<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-6\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">\u201cI recommend rejecting the paper as the benchmark from Doe et al. [A] is not used and the authors include only two baselines.\u201d<br \/>\n<br \/>\n(It is not clear what the additional benchmark would add to the discussion. The baselines the reviewer wishes to see are not specified, nor why these particular baselines are specified. It is not made clear why extra baselines are needed or what they would add to the discussion. It is not clear that it would be feasible to run them. It is not clear what claims are not properly validated, but would be validated with these additional experiments.)<\/td><td class=\"column-2\">\u201cThe paper's selection of baselines and experiments, though incomplete, provides strong evidence for the claims of improved performance for path queries.\u201d<br \/>\n<br \/>\nOR<br \/>\n<br \/>\n\u201cI recommend a reject because the paper claims to provide superior performance versus the state of the art for SPARQL queries, with a main contribution being the optimisation of path queries. However, the benchmarks tested include very few path queries. To validate these claims, it would be necessary to include a benchmark with more (diverse) path queries, such as proposed by Poe et al. [A], in order to better understand the performance of such queries. Also, the baselines included run on disk while the proposed approach runs in memory. A fairer and stronger baseline would be to compare with the in-memory database proposed by Joe et al. [B], which is optimised for path queries, and has a code repository linked from the paper.\u201d<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-7\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">\u201cThe paper reports a precision measure of 46%, which is far too low for the approach to be applicable in practice.\u201d<br \/>\n<br \/>\n(While this may be true, the paper may still improve upon the state of the art for a challenging and important problem. It may lead to further developments that, in turn, lead to approaches applicable in practice. Alternatively, the paper may be reporting an interesting negative result that refutes a commonly held belief\/misconception within the community.)<\/td><td class=\"column-2\">\u201cThe paper reports a precision measure of 46%, which though still too low for most practical applications, is a significant improvement with respect to the state of the art on this challenging and important problem. I think that further improvements can follow from this work, and can eventually yield more precise techniques that are applicable in practice.\u201d<br \/>\n<br \/>\nOR<br \/>\n<br \/>\n\u201cThe paper reports a precision measure of 46%, indicating that Deep Learning methods are outperformed by much simpler classifiers for this task. This is quite a surprising negative result! The ablation study provides very useful insights into why this is the case.\u201d<br \/>\n<br \/>\nOR<br \/>\n<br \/>\n\u201cThe paper reports a precision measure of 46%, which is too imprecise to be useful in practice, and offers only a single percentage point improvement over the baselines tested. On the other hand, recall drops by several percentage points compared to these baselines. Given the somewhat incremental nature of the proposal, and the arguable performance improvement over the baseline method, I lean towards rejecting this paper.\u201d<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-8\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">\u201cI recommend rejecting the paper. Though the approach is new and proves effective, it is also trivial and fairly obvious. It was not difficult to come up with this approach.\u201d<br \/>\n<br \/>\n(Exploring and reporting on \u201cobvious\u201d lines of research is important to advance the community, and often an approach that appears \u201cobvious\u201d is only so in retrospect. Such ideas that provide new insights through simplification are often crucial ideas for advancement. How easy or difficult it was to come up with the approach is subjective and speculative.)<\/td><td class=\"column-2\">\u201cThe approach is not only effective, but it is also quite natural and elegant. It is surprising that nobody has thought of this approach before, and I commend the authors for not only coming up with this idea, but evaluating and publishing it.\u201d<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-9\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">\u201cI think the paper should be rejected as discussion on related works is selective and brief. I can name around 30 to 40 references that were not discussed. Also the new benchmark that the authors created by hand only contains 10,000 examples, which is insufficient for training deep neural networks.\u201d<br \/>\n<br \/>\n(Goals appear unrealistic. Due to space reasons, conference papers cannot reference and discuss every potentially related work. Even dedicated surveys will sometimes miss references. No specific missing references are mentioned. Creating an even larger benchmark by hand appears to demand too much of the authors. Having more than 10,000 examples is an arbitrary goal: if the authors had 20,000, would this be enough, or would the review still ask for more? What would be enough, and why?)<\/td><td class=\"column-2\">\u201cThe paper does not discuss all of the papers in the area, but rather focuses on more recent approaches to the problem using similar machine learning methods. This is understandable for space reasons, but I would recommend at least including the seminal works by Boe et al [A] and Foe et al. [B], and if space permits, works by Koe et al. [C,D] as well.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nIt is commendable that the authors create a new benchmark of 10,000 examples for this problem, which is a useful contribution to the community! However, the dataset by Toe et al. [A] contains 50,000 examples, and is commonly used for training deep neural networks. If the authors' dataset could somehow be extended in future to a similar size, perhaps using a similar methodology on a crowdsourcing platform, it could replace that dataset with much higher-quality examples.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<!-- #tablepress-15 from cache --><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-95a76fc elementor-widget elementor-widget-menu-anchor\" data-id=\"95a76fc\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"menu-anchor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div id=\"do-not\" class=\"elementor-menu-anchor\"><\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-fddeeff elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"fddeeff\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Do not try to deanonymise authors<\/h2>\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-63d280b elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"63d280b\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>We ask reviewers not to go out of their way to try to specifically deanonymise authors.

Or you may be assigned a paper in your area that contains a large amount of technical detail you cannot verify in the time given. Please do not give up right away. Try your best to understand as much as you can of the paper, and to provide a recommendation based on what you understood.

But if you are a relative newcomer to reviewing, and are looking for guidance on how to structure your review, consider adopting the following structure:<\/p><ul><li><b>Overview:<\/b>\u00a0Summarise the paper in your own words in a short, concise paragraph. While the authors (presumably) already know what their paper is about, this demonstrates to the authors, other reviewers, and chairs the extent to which you understood the paper, and what your personal perspective of the paper is. If you can provide a good overview, the authors will tend to value your opinion more. It is also a good exercise to ensure that you understand the paper. (In case there are parts of the paper you did not understand, clarify them here.)<\/li><li><b>Strengths:<\/b>\u00a0Summarise around three main strengths of the paper as concise bullet points. Being able to expand on the positive aspects of the paper can be encouraging to authors, and can also help them to improve their work by building upon those strengths.<\/li><li><b>Weaknesses:<\/b>\u00a0Summarise around three main weaknesses of the paper as concise bullet points. You do not need to go into too much detail yet. Do not include minor issues here. Consider criteria as listed in the call and in the questions of the review form (e.g., relevance, impact, clarity, reproducibility) when preparing the list of weaknesses.<\/li><li><b>Detailed comments:<\/b>\u00a0Discuss in more detail each of the weaknesses. As a guide, you could aim for a paragraph on each weakness. Relate each weakness to specific aspects in the paper. Relate them to the criteria in the call for papers, if necessary. Be constructive, polite and factual. Always try to clarify how the authors could realistically address these weaknesses, providing details. If you cannot clearly justify your reason for listing a weakness here, remove it.<\/li><li><b>Recommendation:<\/b>\u00a0Explicitly state your recommendation (reject, borderline, accept, etc.). Relate your recommendation to the aforementioned strengths and weaknesses. Almost every paper, even strong ones, have weaknesses. Not all weaknesses are grounds for rejection. Some might refer to limitations that could be addressed for future work. Other weaknesses might be adequately addressed as part of the camera-ready version (e.g., being more upfront about certain limitations). In case you accept, make clear what improvements (if any) you expect for a camera ready version. In case you recommend a rejection, provide a summary of directions in which the authors could improve their work.<\/li><li><b>Minor comments:<\/b>\u00a0Provide here minor comments that seem to have an easy and uncontroversial fix, such as spelling mistakes, grammatical mistakes, bugs in notation. In case such errors are frequent, you can opt to provide around three or four illustrative examples, and also list the general issue as a weakness above (e.g., if frequently poor grammar makes the paper very difficult to understand, make that a key weakness).<\/li><\/ul><p>Please note that the ISWC 2022 review form will include an explicit section in which you can summarise the strengths and weaknesses of the paper, and justify your recommendation.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Review guidelines for ISWC 2022 In-Use\/Research\/Resource Tracks Thank you for agreeing to review papers for ISWC 2022 and to help us form the programme!
